Narration means you are telling a story from a certain viewpoint, and there is usually a reason for the telling. All narrative essays have characters, setting, a climax, and most importantly, a plot.

The plot is the focus of the story and is usually revealed chronologically, but there are sometimes flash-forwards and flashbacks. If you are looking to write a personal narrative essay, here are some tips to get you started.

When writing a narrative essay, remember to:

Include sensory and emotional details, so the reader will experience the story, not just read about it.
Allow the story to support the point youâ€™re making, and make reference to that point in the first sentence.
Write in the first or third person.
